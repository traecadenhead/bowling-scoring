# bowling-scoring

This is a web app with backing API to score a game of bowling.

## Getting Started

To run the entire project, clone this Github project and from the parent folder run the following command:

### On Mac

`bash start.sh`

### On PC

`start.bat`

## API

The API is written with javascript using NodeJS and Express. Backing data is stored in json files.

I chose to write the API in NodeJS for two reasons:

1) It's the easiest environment to quickly spin up and run on someone else's machine.
2) I wanted another to project to demonstrate my competency in languages other than what I have lately been working in.

To run tests on the API, browse to the `scoring-api` folder within the project and then run `npm test`.

## UI

The UI is written in javascript as well using React. I wanted to use this opportunity to log more experience with React and am very pleased with how efficient it is to create UIs in.
